1. 🧠 Define the Product
Product Summary:
Reddit Affiliate Opportunity Engine is a web-based platform that discovers high-ranking Reddit threads, identifies affiliate content opportunities, and helps users generate optimized posts or comments containing affiliate links.

The platform targets solo affiliate marketers, SEO strategists, and AI tool promoters looking to insert their affiliate programs naturally into Reddit threads — especially those that rank well on Google.

Target Users:
Reddit-based affiliate marketers

Solo SaaS founders with affiliate programs

Growth hackers & content marketers

Users promoting AI SaaS tools (Jasper, Frase, Writesonic, etc.)

Problem Solved:
Finding profitable, compliant Reddit threads for affiliate insertion is manual and time-consuming. This tool automates opportunity discovery by scraping Reddit, detects thread intent, and highlights threads that rank in Google — streamlining affiliate content strategy on Reddit.

2. 🎯 Goals and KPIs
Goal	KPI
Automatically discover Reddit threads relevant to affiliate programs	At least 30 new relevant threads per day
Classify thread intent (e.g. DISCOVERY, COMPARISON)	85% accuracy on validation set
Detect Reddit threads that rank on Google SERPs	90% coverage of top 100 Google results for tracked keywords
Allow users to generate optimized affiliate comments	1-click comment generation with ≥ 50% CTR on test campaigns
Replace Reddit API with scraper-based MVP	Fully functioning without Reddit API or auth
3. 📌 Assumptions & Constraints
Assumptions:
Most valuable Reddit threads can be discovered via public HTML scraping.

Affiliate keywords can be matched using basic NLP and scoring rules.

Reddit threads that rank in Google are high-value opportunities.

One primary user (you) will test this MVP; scale comes later.

Constraints:
Reddit’s API is not used (due to auth/token restrictions).

Scraper must throttle requests to avoid IP bans or rate-limiting.

Supabase has row limits and rate limits on free tier — handle storage efficiently.

4. 🗂️ Scope of Work
In Scope (MVP):
Reddit HTML crawler using .NET

Thread scoring engine with keyword + intent classification

Google SERP checker (Playwright or alternative .NET-compatible scraper)

C# backend with API endpoints to serve opportunities

React + Next.js frontend for dashboard

Supabase DB to store threads, affiliate metadata, and SERP results

Out of Scope (for MVP):
Auto-posting comments (to avoid violating Reddit TOS)

User accounts or multi-user support

Full analytics or engagement tracking (CTR, earnings)
