✅ Immediate Next Steps:
1. Build the Full Frontend UI (React + Next.js)
Use your repo reddit-revenue-hub as the UI base and connect it to the new backend.

Key Views to Implement:
🏠 Home / Dashboard

Metrics: Upvotes, CTR, Conversions

Top Opportunities (ranked)

Recent Threads Crawled

📂 Subreddits & Niche Setup

Select or categorize subreddits

Add affiliate links, promo codes

Match affiliate programs to niches

📈 Keyword & Thread Discovery

Trending keywords (from crawler / Keyworddit)

Popular Reddit threads (from backend)

SERP results (if fetched)

🤖 AI Content Generation

Form to generate Reddit-style posts/comments

Preview formatting

Tone/purpose (e.g., Discovery, Comparison, Review)

📆 Post Scheduling

Calendar view or time slots

Rotating account simulation (mock for now)

Anti-spam spacing logic

📊 Analytics

Opportunity score trends

CTR heatmaps, post conversion stats

Suggest next best action (e.g., repost, rewrite)

2. API Integration Layer
Create a lib/api.ts or hooks/useApi.ts in the frontend to call:

Endpoint	Purpose
GET /api/opportunities	Load opportunity list
GET /api/threads	Display discovered threads
GET /api/affiliate-programs	Show affiliate data
POST /api/run-crawler	Manually start crawler
POST /api/refresh-opportunities	Trigger opportunity refresh
GET /api/scheduler/status	Cron job status
3. State & Data Fetching (tRPC or SWR/React Query)
Use React Query or tRPC for:

Caching data (e.g., opportunity list)

Revalidating after a crawler run

Loading/success/error UX

4. Design & Component Library
Use TailwindCSS for layout and styling

Consider using shadcn/ui or Radix UI for:

Tabs

Tables

Date Pickers

Modals

5. Seed Data Setup
To allow testing the frontend:

Use .sql or .ts scripts to insert:

Sample affiliate programs (e.g., Jasper AI, WriteSonic)

5–10 Reddit threads (mocked titles/content)

Fake SERP results and opportunity scores

📌 Summary of What’s Next

🎯 High	Build Dashboard UI & modular views
✅ Medium	Add typed API client in frontend
⚙️ Medium	Add React Query or tRPC
🧪 Optional	Add UI tests (e.g., Playwright or Vitest + React Testing Lib)
