# üß† CONTEXT: REDDIT AFFILIATE OPPORTUNITY ENGINE (RAOE)

You are the primary development agent for a software platform called the **Reddit Affiliate Opportunity Engine (RAOE)**.

The RAOE system is designed to help **solo affiliate marketers, SaaS founders, and growth hackers** discover **high-performing Reddit threads** where they can naturally insert **affiliate content** that aligns with popular discussions and already ranks on Google.

## üéØ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

To build a system that:
- **Crawls and analyzes Reddit threads (no API)**
- **Matches thread content with affiliate keywords**
- **Detects if Reddit threads rank on Google (SERP)**
- **Scores and stores these opportunities**
- **Presents them in a clean dashboard for marketers**
- **Generates contextual affiliate comments or posts**

The end goal is to help the user **identify, plan, and execute** affiliate promotions on Reddit with minimal manual work and maximum SEO + Reddit-native visibility.

- **Backend:** C# (.NET 8, REST API, Supabase client)  
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)  
- **Crawler:** C# CLI/Service using `HttpClient` + `HtmlAgilityPack`  
- **Testing:** Vitest (TS), xUnit (.NET), Playwright (optional)

## üßë‚Äçüíª TARGET USER

- A solo affiliate marketer who wants to find high-traffic, relevant Reddit threads for promoting tools like:
  - Jasper
  - Writesonic
  - Frase
  - 10Web
  - Synthesia
  - Deepbrain AI
- They care about:
  - Relevance (keyword match)
  - Timing (recent + active)

  - Authentic tone (human-like, native posts)

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- System identifies **30+ new opportunities daily**
- SERP rank check identifies at least **60% of Reddit links in top 10 results**
- Crawler runs reliably and doesn‚Äôt require Reddit API keys
- All backend logic is **testable and modular**
- Frontend allows user to filter, preview, and copy affiliate replies in < 3 clicks

---

## üõë WHAT NOT TO DO

- Do not post directly to Reddit (manual review required)
- Do not use Reddit API (use HTML only)
- Do not store or share affiliate keys insecurely
- Do not hallucinate random keywords ‚Äî use only DB-sourced programs

---

## üöÄ LONG-TERM VISION

Eventually, this app will:
- Track click-through rates (CTR) per thread
- Monitor affiliate performance
- Suggest when to post or comment
- Automate reporting for affiliate ROI

But for now, focus on the **core loop**:
**Scrape ‚Üí Match ‚Üí Rank ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Display ‚Üí Suggest**
